        <h2>What TurtleSync Does</h2>
        <p>
          TurtleSync is a student led project designed to support sea turtle protection
          by making it easier to report injured turtles, disturbed nests, or hatchlings in danger.
          The project focuses on turning concern into clear information that conservation teams can use.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collects basic details about injured or nesting sea turtles.</li>
          <li>Organizes location and conditions in a clear and consistent format.</li>
          <li>Helps rescue and conservation teams respond more quickly and effectively.</li>
          <li>Raises awareness about safe and legal ways to help protected species.</li>

          <h2>How Reporting Works</h2>
          <p>
            Reporting through TurtleSync is designed to be quick, clear, and safe
            for both the person and the turtle.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight">Observe safely.</span>
              Keep your distance and do not touch, move, or crowd the animal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight">Submit a report.</span>
              Use the TurtleSync form to share what you see, where you are,
              and any important details about the turtle condition or behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight">Add photos if possible.</span>
              Photos can help experts understand the situation without disturbing the turtle.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight">Contact local rescue groups.</span>
              TurtleSync is designed to support communication with organizations that handle
              sea turtle emergencies and nest monitoring.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight">Follow local guidelines.</span>
              Sea turtles are protected by law. All actions should follow posted rules
              and conservation best practices.

              <li>Date and time of sighting.</li>
              <li>Beach name or nearest access point.</li>
              <li>Type of sighting: injured turtle, nesting turtle, hatchlings, or unsure.</li>
              <li>Description of behavior or visible injuries.</li>
              <li>Whether the turtle is in immediate danger.</li>
              <li>Optional photos or video links.</li>

        <h2>Why Sea Turtle Reporting Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Many people want to help when they see a sea turtle that might be hurt or in trouble,
          but they are not always sure what to do. In some cases, people accidentally disturb nests
          or get too close while trying to help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clear reporting gives conservation teams the information they need to respond safely,
          without putting the turtles or the public at risk. TurtleSync was created to close that gap
          by turning concern into organized, useful data that can support real rescue and protection work.

          <h2>About TurtleSync</h2>
          <p>
            TurtleSync began as a student project focused on combining technology with marine conservation.
            It is still growing and will continue to develop through feedback from volunteers,
            conservation professionals, and future college research.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to keep improving the system so that it is easy for anyone on the beach
            to report a concern and support sea turtle protection in a real and practical way.

          <p>
            My name is Ethan D'Amore. I am a high school student with a strong interest in
            animal care, marine conservation, and veterinary science. I have experience volunteering
            with animal shelters, completing veterinary assistant training, and creating systems
            that help people support animals in need.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created TurtleSync to turn my passion for sea turtles and rescue work into a project
            that can make a real difference for animals that cannot speak for themselves.
